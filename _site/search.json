<p>This blog post has been written in Rstudio and using the <code>rmd2md</code> function. When this is run it will convert any file (with the <code>*.rmd</code> extention) that is found within the <code>_rmd</code> folder to markdown that can be parsed by Jekyll and served on github pages. This is then moved to the <code>_posts</code> folder</p>

<p>be sure to include the header between three dashes:</p>

This post is using the <code>kramdown</code> markup flavour, but in the future I would like to use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio IDE</a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">Rmarkdown</a> to add pages to a static server using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I think that the <em>R</em> package <a href="https://github.com/yihui/servr"><strong>servr</strong></a> will also be very useful along with the associated <code>knitr-jekyll</code> repo developed by <a href="https://github.com/yihui">Yihui Xie</a> who also developed the incredibly useful and very powerful <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">knitr</a>.</p>
