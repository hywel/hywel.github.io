<p>This blog post has been written in Rstudio and using the <code>rmd2md</code> function. When this is run it will convert any file (with the <code>*.rmd</code> extention) that is found in the <code>_rmd</code> folder to the markdown that can be parsed by Jekyll and served on github pages.</p>

<p>be sure to include the header between three dashes:</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>The R package <a href="https://github.com/yihui/servr"><strong>servr</strong></a> can be used to set up an HTTP server to serve files under a directory. Since <strong>servr</strong> v0.2, it has added a function <code>servr::jekyll()</code> specifically designed for websites based on Jekyll and R Markdown. The main features of this function are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>R Markdown source files are re-compiled through <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr"><strong>knitr</strong></a> when their corresponding Markdown output files become older<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> than source files;</li>
  <li>The web page will refresh itself automatically in the above case as well;</li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, all you need to do is write your blog posts (R Markdown documents), and you do not need to worry about re-building the website or calling <strong>knitr</strong> commands. Whenever you save a blog post in your text editor, the web page will be updated on the fly. This is particularly handy in the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio IDE</a>, because after you run <code>servr::jekyll()</code> in the console, you can start writing or editing your R Markdown posts, and the HTML output, displayed in the RStudio viewer pane, will be in sync with your source post in the source panel (see the screenshot below).</p>
