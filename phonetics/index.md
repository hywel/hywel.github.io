# Some useful tools for computer aided phonetics

There are many researchers within the phonetic sciences that have compiled comprehensive and very useful lists of tools that they use for phonetics[^1]. This small list doesn't seek to replace these, but I will hopefully add to this and provide some links to tutorial information in the future.

## Labeling and Segmenting 

- [Praat](www.praat.org): Should be in every linguist's toolbox.
- [Elan](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/): from The Language Archive at MPI.
- [Emu](https://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU-webApp/) The webapp front end for the [EmuR Speech Database Management System](http://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html)

## Analysis and Graphical Representation

- [R](r-project.org)
- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com): A development environment and GUI frontend for R
- various R packages including `ggplot2` and the whole tidyverse suite of packages.

## Report Generation

- [LaTex] specifically XeLaTex, which although sometimes problems of its own, makes using Unicode in LaTex much simpler.
- Markdown - for when I can't be bothered with LaTex (read:always)
