## Practical Phonetics

- My favourite site for visualising and learning the sounds of the IPA: [Seeing Speech](http://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk)
  - Lawson, E., Stuart-Smith, J., Scobbie, J. M., Nakai, S., Beavan, D., Edmonds, F., Edmonds, I., Turk, A., Timmins, C., Beck, J., Esling, J., Leplatre, G., Cowen S., Barras, W., Durham, M. (2015). Seeing Speech: an articulatory web resource for the study of Phonetics. University of Glasgow. 1st April 2015. http://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/
- A great clickable IPA chart on that site that shows MRI, Ultrasound and some animations of the different speech sounds defined by the IPA ([IPA Chart](http://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/ipachart/display.php?chart=1&datatype=1&speaker=1))
