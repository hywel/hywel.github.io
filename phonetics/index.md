- My favourite site for visualising and learning the sounds of the IPA: [Seeing Speech](www.seeingspeech.ac.uk)
- A great clickable IPA chart on that site that shows MRI, Ultrasound and some animations of the different speech sounds defined by the IPA ([IPA Chart](http://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/ipachart/display.php?chart=1&datatype=1&speaker=1))
