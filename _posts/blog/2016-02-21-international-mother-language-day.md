Today is International Mother Language Day. Although it is not my mother tongue (or even my grandmother tongue), it is my great grandmother tongue.
 
> Shwmae, Sut ydych chi? (Welsh)  
> "Hello, How are you"
 
Some other languages that are close to my heart although they too are not my mother tongues.
 
> Baleh yire? (Bininj Kunwok, Kunwinjku) 
> "How (where) are you going?"
 
> Manymak, ngurra. (Yolŋu Matha, Gumatj) 
> "I'm OK/good."
 
My mother language is English which is that of many people across Australia. This is just one amongst so many. Here's to celebrating all of the languages spoken around Australia right now as a mother tongue!
 
> Hello, how are you? I'm fine thanks, and you? (Australian English)
> "Hello, how are you? I'm fine thanks, and you?"
 
Here are some links to resources on some of the languages mentioned:
