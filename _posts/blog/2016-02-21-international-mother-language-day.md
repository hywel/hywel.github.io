Today is International Mother Language Day. Below are a few ways to say hello in some languages that are dear to me. Welsh, although it is not my mother tongue--or even my grandmother tongue--*is* my great grandmother tongue.
 
> Shwmae, Sut ydych chi? (Welsh)  
> "Hello, How are you"
 
Some other languages that are close to my heart include some languages spoken in Australia, these too are not my mother tongues.
 
> Ngudda kamak?, Baleh yire? (Bininj Kunwok, Kunwinjku)   
> "How are you? Where are you going?"
 
Reply (in another language): 
 
> Manymak, ngurra. (Yolŋu Matha, Gumatj)  
> "I'm OK/good."
 
I live in Australia and my mother language is British English . In my daily life I speak Australian English. These are just two amongst so many languages and varieties spoken across the Australian continent. Here's to celebrating all of the languages spoken as a mother tongue around Australia as we speak!
 
> Hello, how are you? I'm fine thanks, and you? (Australian English)  
> "Hello, how are you? I'm fine thanks, and you?"
 
Here are some links to resources on some of the languages mentioned in this post:
