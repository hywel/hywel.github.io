# A test of HTML5 audio in Jekyll

Here are a couple of audio files (pulmonic consonants between two vowels).  

<audio controls>
  <source src="/audio/arda.wav">
<p>Your browser does not support audio playback, download the file:</p>
  <a href="/audio/arda.wav">WAV</a></audio>  

Here is some text to break them up.
  
## Can I use an waveform as the image?
This is an open question.

<audio controls>
  <source src="/audio/aGa.wav">
<p>Your browser does not support audio playback, download the file:</p>
  <a href="/audio/aGa.wav">WAV</a></audio>
