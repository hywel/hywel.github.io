It has been a long time since updates and considering the effort I put in to set up this frame work, I thought I should start this up again. I will try to post some articles/tutorials on the new [Emu Speech Database](http://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html) and my experiences with using it for teaching and research.
 
One of the best things about using EmuR is that it integrates well into my existing R environment and allows the use of modern statistical/visualisation tools. 
 
Stay tuned...
