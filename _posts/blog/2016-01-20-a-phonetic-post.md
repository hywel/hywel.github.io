## Diacritics ##
* Diacritics are often a problem
* pʰɜt̪o
* Rə̄
* Su̺ [^1]
 
[^1]: Rendering on Chrome seems different so will keep close eye on any differences.
 
All of the diacritics seem to render correctly [^2]. I will check them along the way.
 
[^2]: Apart from where noted.
 
Below I will embed an audio file from [soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com).
