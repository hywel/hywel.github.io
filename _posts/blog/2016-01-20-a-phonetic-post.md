I am now testing the work flow to see how the phonetic fonts are rendered and and check unicode compliance.

## Diacritics ##
* Diacritics are often a problem
* pʰɜt̪o
* Rə̄
* R̀
 
All of the diacritics seem to render correctly. I will check them along the way.
 
Below I will embed an audio file from [soundcloud](htpp:www.soundcloud.com).
 
{% include embed1.html %}
 
In the future this will include a relavent phonetic example :).
